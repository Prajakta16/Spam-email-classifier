# Spam-email-classifier
As part of CS6200-Information Retrieval, built a Spam Classifier using Machine Learning and ElasticSearch.
Cleaned, processed, explored the emails from https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/treccorpus07/ and applied Machine Learning models to classify email as being a spam email or a valid one.
